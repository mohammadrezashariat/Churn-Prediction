# Binary classification model with scikit-learn to predict customer churn

Build a binary classification model to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., discontinue their subscription) or not based on various features in the dataset. You are given a dataset containing customer information and whether they churned or not in the past. Your task is to use this dataset to train a machine learning model and evaluate its performance on a test set.

Dataset: You can use the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.
